 <h1>Breakout Game in Python</h1>
    <p>A classic arcade Breakout game built using Python and <strong>Pygame</strong>. Control the paddle using the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to bounce the ball and break all the bricks. The game features scoring, lives, and win/loss conditions.</p>

  <h2>How to Run</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure Python is installed on your system.</li>
        <li>Install Pygame using <code>pip install pygame</code></li>
        <li>Run the game using <code>python breakout.py</code></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Left Arrow:</strong> Move paddle left</li>
        <li><strong>Right Arrow:</strong> Move paddle right</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        I approached this project by planning the game flow, starting with the ball and paddle movement, then adding bricks and collision logic. The most challenging part was handling collisions correctly. 
        For the next project, I would use classes and modularize the code. My biggest learning was combining game physics with user input.
